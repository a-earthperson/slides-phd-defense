	abstract = {Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of nuclear safety systems is paramount for preventing severe accidents and ensuring operational safety. This study introduces a method for quantifying the unavailability margins of safety systems, employing inverse estimation techniques to deduce event sequence frequencies. The proposed method is demonstrated on a case study involving a liquid metal fire scenario from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) Level 1 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). Uncertainties are modeled by assuming log-normal distributions for all events. For a demonstrative event tree with known end-state frequencies, our method accurately deduced the probabilities of functional events within a small error margin. The results show errors of approximately (1.08 ± 0.96)\% for the means, (4.39 ± 7.09)\% for the 5 th , and (3.82 ± 5.91)\% for the 95 th percentiles, respectively. The analysis highlights the method's strengths, such as its ability to estimate distributions for rare events, but also notes limitations, including dependence on specific distribution assumptions and challenges in optimization techniques. Despite these, the case study's results offer the potential for drawing insights for improving safety system design and operational strategies. Additionally, we have made this method available as an open-source Python tool named inverse-canopy, part of the OpenPRA toolkit [1]. The study concludes by discussing the potential of this methodology for broader application in PRAs and suggests future work to expand it into a Bayesian inverse uncertainty quantification framework.},
